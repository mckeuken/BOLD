One of the challenges of climbing in the great outdoors is actually finding the route that you want to climb. While the topo's are essential, the handdrawn maps (which aren't necessarily at scale) arent always that clear. So while finding your project is part of the fun, at times it might be nice to have some help. Especially if half of your mates are pointing to the left and the others are pointing to the right.. 

To that end we decided on a slogan along the lines of: 'less whining, more climbing' and started on an iOS app to locate boulders in the forest based on their GPS loc.

This is a first prototype to see if a few things work:
- augmented reality: seems to work, whether it is usefull is a different discussion
- coordinates precise enough to be get at the right side of the rock: seems oke
- guidance through the forest: mwa.. apple maps don't really do graveltracks but at least you get an arrow pointing you in the right direction...

Things that need doing:
- selection filters (area, name, rating, type of problem)
- more info (direct link to bleau.info?)
- increase the database
- beter maps in the forest (check: open streetmaps, komoot, strava heatmaps)?
